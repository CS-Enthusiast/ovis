1) note - there is an error in the flags if -T is before -c the -c will get rid 
of the by_time flag

2) looks like comp and time are independent keys.
if you put things out of order in time for a component, then the component iterator will write them out in the order they were put in.

3) the keys looks like they are made at teh SOS_BEGIN definition. i dont know if
we can add a key later.

4) right now the code looks like it make two iterators and then goes thru one or the other and then does comparison on each data item.

5) running:
./stats -p /home/brandt/Ann/sos/src/junk -m "12/31/69 16:00:01" -M "12/31/69 17:00:50" -c 1-5 node:active 

./stats -p /home/brandt/Ann/sos/src/junk -m "12/31/69 16:00:00" -M "12/31/69 17:00:50" -c 1-4  -o /home/brandt/Ann/LDMS/tools_contrib/sosjobstats/junk/testout node:inactive node:active
