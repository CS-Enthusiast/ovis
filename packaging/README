PURPOSE:

This directory is primarily for packagers/maintainers of OVIS tools,
not for beginning developers. As such, good scripting
skills are needed to understand most of the files herein.

Do NOT expect to be able to run any script in here in random environments.

Secondarily, a few scripts (make-all-*) are provided demonstrating manual builds
with various configuration options on recent platforms. With these
scripts, *** YOUR Mileage May Vary***
Don't hesitate to contact ovis-help@sandia.gov if you are having build problems.
The wiki at ovis.ca.sandia.gov also has some build documentation.

SUPPORT:

Packaging is provided for the RHEL 6/7 and SUSE 11/12 rpm-based environments.
Secondary build examples may include ubuntu/centos as well.
Legacy systems support, as last known working, is in subdirectory retired/.
Host-specific support for supercomputing environments is in subdirectory hosts/.

RPM SUPPORT:

The packages produced here live use the "ldms-all" prefixes. as 
there are prior Linux packages with conflicting names or content.

This packaging scheme aims to produce relocatable RPMS, in violation of
Redhat/Fedora packaging standards, as commonly required on HPC platforms.
Linux dynamic libraries are not normally relocatable once installed, so
to make relocation work the environment MUST specify LD_LIBRARY_PATH at
runtime.


BUILDING ldms RPMs in old environments:

libevent2 must be built and accessible before ldms can be configured.
Because RHEL 6.x does not support libevent2, we install libevent
as part of this rpm build in an LDMS-specific location. 

Packaging is done by:
	- preinstalling a libevent rpm.
	- checking out the ovis source tree.
	- ./packaging/firerpms

The result (if all is well and the needed devel packages for ssl, rdma, etc
are installed) will be a set of rpms in centos-* directories at the top of the
source tree.
