The Hadoop samplers in this directory are for both Hadoop 1.2 and Hadoop 2.2.

The Hadoop Metrics2 Sinks (Java Code) are in hadoop-sinks and hadoop-2-sinks.

 - hadoop-sinks contains the Hadoop Metrics2 Sinks compatible with Hadoop 1.2.
 - hadoop-2-sinks contains the Hadoop Metrics 2 Sinks compatible with Hadoop 2.2.

Makefile.am builds every sampler if '--enable-hadoop' is given when configure
'ldms.' However, Makefile.am does not build the Java code. For hadoop-sinks, you
need to compile it yourself. On the other hand, we provide pom.xml in
hadoop-2-sinks, so you can use Maven to create the jar file for the OVIS Sinks
that are compatible with Hadoop 2.2.

The OVIS Sinks for both Hadoop 1.2 and Hadoop 2.2 have the same functionalities.
	- OvisMetricNameSink collects the metric names.
	- OvisSink sends the metrics to the ldms samplers.

The instruction to configure Hadoop (both 1.2 and 2.2) to use OVIS Sinks can be
find in hadoop-2-sinks/README.
