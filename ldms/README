	LDMS requires OVIS/lib, readline and the event2 libraries.  Please
install OVIS/lib package before building LDMS.

	For readline, you will need to either install the readline-devel
package, or you will need to specify an alternative library. Some distributions
put readline in libreadline, and others put it in libtermcap.  The
--with-ldflags-readline option is provided for this purpose.

        The event2 libraries are relatively new and not many distributions have
an RPM for them yet. For this reason, the libevent source is provided as a
sub-module to the OVIS git repository. Use 'git submodule init' and then 'git
submodule update' to have the source checked out into ./util/event2. From there
it can be configured built and installed for your system. Note that the
--with-libevent option is provided so that you can tell configure where you
installed libevent2.

	In the case that you want SOS plugin for LDMS, please configure with
option --enable-sos  to enable SOS plugin. If OVIS/sos library is not installed
in the standard location (/usr or /usr/local), please specify
--with-sos=<SOS_PREFIX> to provide a path to its location.
