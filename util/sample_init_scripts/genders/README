To use ldmsd with libgenders-based configuration,
copy the systemd/ or sysv/ files  here into your /etc or imageroot/etc/
and modify them, or use the relocatable TOSS rpms to install directly
with the localstatedir location used on your system.

WITH RPM:
Assuming your system uses something writable other than /var as localstatedir:
	rpm -Uvh --relocate /var=something ovis-3.*.rpm
Or if /var is writable by daemons, then just:
	rpm -Uvh ovis-3.*.rpm

WITH MANUAL copying:

(assuming /var is localstatedir):

For systemd on rhel (assuming ovis installed in /usr):
cp -r /usr/share/doc/ovis-3.3.1/sample_init_scripts/genders/systemd/etc /
cp /usr/share/doc/ovis-3.3.1/sample_init_scripts/genders/systemd/ldms*.service /usr/lib/systemd/system

For sysvinit on rhel (assuming ovis installed in /usr):
Note that sysconfig content under sysv is a symbolic link to systemd sysconfig and under some
OS versions, /etc/init.d is itself a symbolic link to /etc/rc.d/init.d. So copy in chunks:

cp -r /usr/share/doc/ovis-3.3.1/sample_init_scripts/genders/sysv/etc/init.d/ldms* /etc/init.d
cp -r /usr/share/doc/ovis-3.3.1/sample_init_scripts/genders/sysv/etc/sysconfig/ldms.d /etc/sysconfig/

Then for either systemd or sysvinit, modify 
/etc/sysconfig/ldms.d/ClusterGenders/genders.local as needed.

If desired, ldms attributes can be kept together with regular attributes in 
/etc/genders.  This will facilitate starting/stopping data collection with
	pdsh -g ldmsd service ldmsd start
or
	pdsh -g systemctl daemon-reload
	pdsh -g systemctl start ldmsd

Edit /etc/sysconfig/ldms.d/ldmsd.local.conf to specify the correct name of the 
genders file for your system. Set LDMS_GENDERS=/pathname if you do not use an
/etc/genders or /etc/sysconfig/ldms.d/ClusterGenders/genders.local.

Edit /etc/sysconfig/ldms.d/ldmsd.local.conf to specify the correct value of
LDMS_LOG_PATH if you want to log to a file rather than the syslog or journal.

See man page ldms-attributes for attribute details in the genders file.
See man page ldmsd-genders for environment variables and daemon startup overview.
