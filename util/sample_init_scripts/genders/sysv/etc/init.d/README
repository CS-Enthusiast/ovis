The file ldmsd.template is provided for running multiple ldmsd instances
under sysvinit. To make a new service
for serving a remote machine X, run the template through
sed like so:
cat ldmsd.template | sed -e 's/hermes/X/g' > /etc/init.d/ldmsd.X

Then you can use
service ldmsd.X start
service ldmsd.X stop
to manage the daemon.
