This directory collects the genders configurations (or symbolic links to them)
needed to assemble final aggregation and storage configurations for LDMS.

Files named genders.$HOST are the /etc/genders files as seen from a node in the cluster $HOST.

Files named $STOREHOST.genders.$HOST are the additional gender values needed
on $STOREHOST to configure a last-level ldmsd to aggregate and store for $HOST.

The final genders file needed to monitor/store cluster $HOST on $STOREHOST is the concatenation of genders.$HOST and $STOREHOST.genders.$HOST. These final scratch files are typically written to /var/run/ldmsd/genderscratch/$STOREHOST.$HOST.


Example 1:
A three level setup among hosts
poseidon (level 0: collect) ubuntu 16 systemd
hermes (level 1 agg and collect) rhel7 systemd
twain (level 2 agg and store) rhel7 systemd
