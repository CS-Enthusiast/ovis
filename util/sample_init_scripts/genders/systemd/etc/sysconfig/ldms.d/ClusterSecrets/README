This directory is the default home for LDMS authentication secret files (or links to them). An example is provided; the key value in it should always be
changed before production deployment.

The LDMS_AUTH_FILE configuration variable can point to a file anywhere, however.
The authentication file must not be group or world readable or writable.

When running multiple ldmsd instances to monitor remote hosts,
the convention for this directory is to name the secret files
$LDMSCLUSTER.ldmsauth.conf.
