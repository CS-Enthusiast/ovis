This directory contains ldms plugin-specific config file snippets and
config file snippet generators.

By convention the static file snippets need only list 
on a single line the plugin-specific options to be added to all 
instances of the plugin started by ldmsd. Selection of
which plugins are started is managed by libgenders attributes
or environment variables. Where a plugin
supports multiple calls to configure, additional lines
in the text file should begin with
	config name=PLUGIN
where PLUGIN is replaced with the specific name.

By convention generated file snippets for samplers must contain 
complete 'config' lines including (where needed) name, producer, 
component_id, & instance.
The arguments supplied to the collector plugins are
	plugin-name producer-name host sample-interval sample-offset
The generator must also write out the plugin start command.

By convention generate file snippets for storage must contain
complete 'config' lines.
The arguments supplied to the store plugins are
        plugin-name hostname schema-list
where schema-list is the list of schemas the store should 
capture.
The generator must also write out the plugin start command.
