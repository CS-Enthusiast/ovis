This directory contains the systemd/sysvinit version of init script support
for cluster and genders support.

Gender-based TOSS clusters define network topology in /etc/genders
The scripts here (ldms.d/ldmsd) work without making the
admin repeat the information in an LDMS format that can get out of
sync with the master genders file (unless the admin wants to).

The process for loading %I (local or a remote name) is:
ldmsd-pre-systemd
	includes ldms-functions
	includes ldms.d/ldmsd
		includes ldms.d/ldmsd.%I.conf
	checks ldmsd options and defaults
	dumps environment file for use by /usr/bin/ldmsd-wrapper.sh
