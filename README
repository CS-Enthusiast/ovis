BUILDING NOTE
The top-level automake doesn't work because the dependent modules doesn't
understand source structure of the module they depended on. They are managed
separately. Hence, one-by-one module installation is required.

Please build the modules in the following order:

1. lib
	This module is needed by everybody.

2. sos
	Need 'lib' to be *installed* before building. You can tell sos about the
'lib' installation directory by giving it --with-ovis-lib option at configure
time.

3. ocm
	Need 'lib' to be *installed* before building. You can tell ocm about the
'lib' installation directory by giving it --with-ovis-lib option at configure
time.
	OCM is optionally needed by ldms, baler, me and komondor. We encourage
you to use it for configuration distribution.

4. ldms
	Need 'lib' to be *installed* before building. You can tell ldms about
the 'lib' installation directory by giving it --with-ovis-lib option at
configure time.
	sos is optional. If you wish to use store_sos plugin, then sos is needed
to be installed too. Installed sos directory is referred to by --with-sos
option.
	ocm is optional. Specify a path to installed ocm directory with
--with-ocm at configure time.

5. baler
	Need 'lib' to be *installed* before building. You can tell baler about
the 'lib' installation directory by giving it --with-ovis-lib option at
configure time.
	Need 'sos' to be *installed* before building. You can tell baler about
the 'sos' installation directory by giving it --with-sos option at
configure time.
	ocm is optional. Specify a path to installed ocm directory with
--with-ocm at configure time.

6. me
	Need 'lib' to be *installed* before building. You can tell me about
the 'lib' installation directory by giving it --with-ovis-lib option at
configure time.
	ocm is optional. Specify a path to installed ocm directory with
--with-ocm at configure time.

7. komondor
	Need 'lib' to be *installed* before building. You can tell komondor
about the 'lib' installation directory by giving it --with-ovis-lib option at
configure time.
	ocm is optional. Specify a path to installed ocm directory with
--with-ocm at configure time.
