BUILDING NOTE
The top-level automake doesn't work because the dependent modules doesn't
understand source structure of the module they depended on. They are managed
separately. Hence, one-by-one module installation is required.

Please build the modules in the following order:

0. util/libevent
	Please install libevent2 development package from your OS repository, or
build it from source by: 'git submodule init && git submodule update' and go to
./util/libevent, and build libevent2 from there.
	libevent is required by ldms/ and zap in lib/.

0.1 the usage of convenient script:
	After libevent installation, you can edit
./all-autogen-configure-make-makeinstall.sh script to your liking and use this
convenient script to build and install modules in OVIS. The variables in the
file that you may want to modify:

- ENABLE: enabling features in modules (please see ./configure --help in each
  module to see details). The default values in the script should be OK for a
  generic installation.

- DISABLE: disabling features in modules. The default values in the script
  should be OK for a generic installation.

- LIBEVENT_PREFIX: specifying location of libevent if it is not installed in
  standard location (like /usr or /usr/local).

- LIST: space-delimited ordered list of modules to install. Feel free to remove
  unwanted modules, but please preserve the order.

- sudo: If you wish to install as a normal user, just remove the sudo in line 50
  and comment out line 51.

Otherwise, you can manually build each module by the following order:

1. lib
	This module is needed by everybody.

2. sos
	Need 'lib' to be *installed* before building. You can tell sos about the
'lib' installation directory by giving it --with-ovis-lib option at configure
time.

3. ocm
	Need 'lib' to be *installed* before building. You can tell ocm about the
'lib' installation directory by giving it --with-ovis-lib option at configure
time.
	OCM is optionally needed by ldms, baler, me and komondor. We encourage
you to use it for configuration distribution.

4. ldms
	Need 'lib' to be *installed* before building. You can tell ldms about
the 'lib' installation directory by giving it --with-ovis-lib option at
configure time.
	sos is optional. If you wish to use store_sos plugin, then sos is needed
to be installed too. Installed sos directory is referred to by --with-sos
option.
	ocm is optional. Specify a path to installed ocm directory with
--with-ocm at configure time.

5. baler
	Need 'lib' to be *installed* before building. You can tell baler about
the 'lib' installation directory by giving it --with-ovis-lib option at
configure time.
	Need 'sos' to be *installed* before building. You can tell baler about
the 'sos' installation directory by giving it --with-sos option at
configure time.
	ocm is optional. Specify a path to installed ocm directory with
--with-ocm at configure time.

6. me
	Need 'lib' to be *installed* before building. You can tell me about
the 'lib' installation directory by giving it --with-ovis-lib option at
configure time.
	ocm is optional. Specify a path to installed ocm directory with
--with-ocm at configure time.

7. komondor
	Need 'lib' to be *installed* before building. You can tell komondor
about the 'lib' installation directory by giving it --with-ovis-lib option at
configure time.
	ocm is optional. Specify a path to installed ocm directory with
--with-ocm at configure time.
